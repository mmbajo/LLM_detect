# LLM_detect

Welcome to the `LLM_detect` repository, a dedicated space for my participation in the [LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text?rvi=1) Kaggle competition. This project is currently a work in progress as the competition is ongoing.

## Application Demo
An initial version of the application is live and can be accessed here: [LLM Detect Demo](https://llm-detect.streamlit.app/). This application is particularly special as it's dedicated to a school teacher friend dealing with tech-savvy students. The primary goal of this app is to discern whether a given essay text has been generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) or not.

## Repository Structure
- **Notebooks**: The core of the project's scripts and development work is located in the `notebooks/` folder. This will be the hub for all the development scripts used throughout the competition.

## Future Updates
As the competition concludes, I plan to enhance this repository with:
- A comprehensive training and inference pipeline.
- Regular updates to the application based on the insights and methodologies developed during the competition.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates!

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository or submit pull requests. Any contributions, suggestions, or feedback are highly appreciated as we navigate through the challenges of this competition together.
